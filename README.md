# Advent of Code 2017

My AoC '17 solutions. Written in JavaScript, Python and whatever
else I decide to randomly use. http://adventofcode.com

My solutions will almost certainly not be the most optimized, best practices or
heck even actually work properly.

### JavaScript

Run using Node 8 (or lower maybe, who knows).

Run the days solutions using `node day1`, `node day2`, etc.

#### Tests

First install the dev deps via `npm install`.

Then run the tests (and automatically runs solutions for some reason) using `npm test
day1`, `npm test day2`, etc.
